<h3><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/search/?q=ShareKernel">ShareKernel</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>ShareKernel[] initiates sharing of the kernel between the front end and a link to another program such as Java
        or .NET. You typically call ShareKernel to allow the kernel to respond to Java- or .NET-based user interfaces.
        For backwards compatibility, calling ShareKernel[] with no arguments initiates sharing with the Java link, but
        new code should specify the intended link, either by calling ShareKernel[JavaLink[]] or ShareKernel[NETLink[]].
        If the specified link is already sharing the kernel, ShareKernel does nothing. ShareKernel returns a token that
        you should save and later pass to UnshareKernel to unregister the request for kernel sharing. ShareKernel is
        unnecessary in Mathematica 5.1 and later because the kernel is always ready for computations that originate in
        Java or .NET, even when busy with another computation.
