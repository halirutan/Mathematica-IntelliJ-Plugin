<ul>
    <li>BinaryReadList["file"] reads all remaining bytes from a file, and returns them as a list of integers from 0 to
        255.
    <li>BinaryReadList["file",<em>type</em>] reads objects of the specified type from a file, until the end of the file
        is reached. The list of objects read is returned.
    <li>BinaryReadList["file",{<em>type</em><sub>1</sub>,<em>type</em><sub>2</sub>,

        }] reads objects with a sequence of types, until the end of the file is reached.
    <li>BinaryReadList["file",<em>types</em>,<em>n</em>] reads only the first <em>n</em> objects of the specified types.
