<ul>
    <li>DOSTextFormat is an option for OpenRead, OpenWrite, and OpenAppend that specifies whether files should be opened
        in text mode. With DOSTextFormat -> True, Mathematica uses the normal text format for the type of computer on
        which Mathematica is running. Text mode typically entails translation of a text file's line-ending characters
        into the newline character "\n". With DOSTextFormat -> False, files are opened in "binary mode", in which no
        such translation is performed. On some systems, there is no difference between text mode and binary mode.
