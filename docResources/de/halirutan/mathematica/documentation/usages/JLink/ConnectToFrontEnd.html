<h3><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/JLink/ref/ConnectToFrontEnd.html">ConnectToFrontEnd</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>ConnectToFrontEnd[] establishes a link to the notebook front end for use by the UseFrontEnd[] function. It
        returns True to indicate that the link was established correctly, and False otherwise. The front end will be
        launched if required. Although UseFrontEnd will call ConnectToFrontEnd if necessary, ConnectToFrontEnd is
        provided to allow programmers to conveniently control when the front end is launched and to receive a True/False
        indication if it was successful. This function will typically be called only from an external program that is
        driving the kernel, not from code executing in a front end notebook.
