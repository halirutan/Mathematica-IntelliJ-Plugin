</h3>
<ul>
    <li>$FrontEndInitializationFunction is a function that you can assign to execute when the front end link is first
        established by ConnectToFrontEnd[]. Your function will be passed the link to the front end, and it should return
        False to indicate that your initialization was not successful and the front end connection should be abandoned.
        Any other return value will allow the front end connection to proceed normally.
