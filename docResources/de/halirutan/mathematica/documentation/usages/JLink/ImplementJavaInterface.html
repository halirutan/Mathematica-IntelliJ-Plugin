<ul>
    <li>ImplementJavaInterface[interfaces, handlerMappings] uses the Dynamic Proxy facility of Java to create a new Java
        class and return an object of that class that implements the named interface or list of interfaces by calling
        back into the Wolfram Language. In short, it lets you create a Java object that implements a given Java
        interface entirely in Mathematica code. The handlerMappings argument is a list of rules that specify the name of
        the Java method and the name of the method that will be called in Mathematica to implement the body of that
        method, as in "intfMeth1"->"mathHandlerMethod1". The arguments passed to the Mathematica method will be exactly
        the arguments originally passed to the Java method.
