<h3><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/JLink/ref/GetJavaException.html">GetJavaException</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>GetJavaException[] returns the Java exception object that was thrown in the most recent call from the Wolfram
        Language to Java. It returns Null if no exception was thrown in the most recent call. You can use
        GetJavaException in conjunction with $JavaExceptionHandler to implement a custom exception-handling scheme in
        the Wolfram Language.
