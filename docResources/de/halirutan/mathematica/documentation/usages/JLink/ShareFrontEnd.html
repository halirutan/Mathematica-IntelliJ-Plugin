<h3><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/search/?q=ShareFrontEnd">ShareFrontEnd</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>ShareFrontEnd[link] initiates sharing of the notebook front end with an external program such as Java or .NET.
        For backwards compatibility, calling ShareFrontEnd[] with no arguments initiates sharing with the Java link, but
        new code should specify the intended link, either by calling ShareFrontEnd[JavaLink[]] or
        ShareFrontEnd[NETLink[]]. If the front end is already being shared by that link, ShareFrontEnd does nothing.
        ShareFrontEnd returns a token that you should save and later pass to UnshareFrontEnd to unregister the request
        for front end sharing.
