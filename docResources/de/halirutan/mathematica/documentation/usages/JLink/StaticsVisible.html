<h3><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/search/?q=StaticsVisible">StaticsVisible</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>StaticsVisible is an option to LoadJavaClass (in J/Link) and LoadNETType (in .NET/Link) that specifies whether
        the class-specific context in which static method and field definitions are created should be placed on
        $ContextPath. If you load a class named "com.foo.Bar" containing a static method named baz, with the option
        StaticsVisible->True you could call the method simply with baz[args]. With StaticsVisible->False, you would have
        to write Bar`baz[args]. The default setting is False, to eliminate the possibility of name conflicts leading to
        shadowing problems.
