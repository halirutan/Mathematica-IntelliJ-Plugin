    <li>SurfaceColor[<em>dcol</em>] is a three-dimensional graphics directive which specifies that the surfaces which
        follow should act as diffuse reflectors of light with a color given by <em>dcol</em>.
    <li>SurfaceColor[<em>dcol</em>,<em>scol</em>] specifies that a specular reflection component should be included,
        with a color given by <em>scol</em>.
    <li>SurfaceColor[<em>dcol</em>,{<em>scol</em>,<em>n</em>}] specifies that the reflection should occur with specular
        exponent
        <math>
            <ms>&#160;</ms>
        </math>
        <em>n</em>.
    <li>SurfaceColor[<em>dcol</em>,<em>scol</em>,<em>gcol</em>] specifies that a color <em>gcol</em> should be added as
        if there were an intrinsic glow in the polygon.
