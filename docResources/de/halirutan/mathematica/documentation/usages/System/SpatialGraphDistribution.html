<ul>
    <li>SpatialGraphDistribution[<em>n</em>,<em>r</em>] represents a spatial distribution for graphs with <em>n</em>
        vertices uniformly distributed over the unit square and edges between vertices that are at distance at most <em>r</em>.
    <li>SpatialGraphDistribution[<em>n</em>,<em>r</em>,<em>d</em>] represents a spatial distribution for graphs with
        vertices uniformly distributed over the <em>d</em>-dimensional unit square.
    <li>SpatialGraphDistribution[<em>n</em>,<em>r</em>,<em>dist</em>] represents a spatial distribution for graphs with
        vertices distributed according to the probability distribution <em>dist</em>.
