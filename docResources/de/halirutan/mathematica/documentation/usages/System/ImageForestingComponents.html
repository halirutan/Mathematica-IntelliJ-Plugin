<ul>
    <li>ImageForestingComponents[<em>image</em>] finds a segmentation of <em>image</em>, returning an integer matrix in
        which positive integers label different components.
    <li>ImageForestingComponents[<em>image</em>,<em>marker</em>] tries to find a segmentation into components that
        include pixels indicated by <em>marker</em>.
    <li>ImageForestingComponents[<em>image</em>,<em>marker</em>,<em>r</em>] finds components that are connected at a
        pixel scale given by <em>r</em>.
