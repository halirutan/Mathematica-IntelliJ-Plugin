<ul>
    <li>NonlocalMeansFilter[<em>image</em>,<em>r</em>] applies a nonlocal means filter to <em>image</em> by comparing a
        range <em>r</em> neighborhood to its nearby neighborhoods.
    <li>NonlocalMeansFilter[<em>image</em>,<em>r</em>,<em>ns</em>] assumes an additive noise power value <em>ns</em> for
        comparing neighborhoods.
    <li>NonlocalMeansFilter[<em>image</em>,<em>r</em>,<em>ns</em>,<em>w</em>] compares neighborhoods in a range
        <em>w</em> window.
