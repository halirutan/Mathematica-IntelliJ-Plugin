<h3><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/JLink/ref/ShowJavaConsole.html">ShowJavaConsole</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>ShowJavaConsole[] displays the Java console window and begins capturing output sent to the Java System.out and
        System.err streams. Anything written to these streams before ShowJavaConsole is first called will not appear,
        but subsequent output will be captured even if the window is closed and reopened. Only the most recent one
        thousand lines of output are displayed. ShowJavaConsole["stdout"] captures only System.out, and
        ShowJavaConsole["stderr"] captures only System.err.
