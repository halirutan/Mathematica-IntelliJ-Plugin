    <li>$ThisPeriodical is a variable that holds the id of the currently-executing periodical task. You can use
        $ThisPeriodical from within your periodical task to alter its time interval for future calls (by calling
        SetPeriodicalInterval) or to remove it entirely (with RemovePeriodical).
