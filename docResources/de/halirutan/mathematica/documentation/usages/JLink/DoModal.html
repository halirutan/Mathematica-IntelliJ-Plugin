<h3><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/JLink/ref/DoModal.html">DoModal</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>DoModal[] does not return until the Java side sends an expression of the form EvaluatePacket[EndModal[___]]. Use
        DoModal to have a program wait until some Java user-interface action signals that it can proceed. Typically,
        this would be used to implement a modal dialog box that needs to return a result to Mathematica when it is
        dismissed. DoModal returns the EndModal[args] expression.
