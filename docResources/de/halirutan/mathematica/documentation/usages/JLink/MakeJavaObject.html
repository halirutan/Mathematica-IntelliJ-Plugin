<ul>
    <li>MakeJavaObject[expr] constructs a new Java object whose "value" is expr. The expression must be an integer (in
        which case the created object is of type java.lang.Integer), real (java.lang.Double), String (java.lang.String),
        or True/False (java.lang.Boolean). It can also be a list or matrix of numbers, Strings, or True/False, in which
        case the returned object is a Java array of the corresponding primitive type (for example,
        MakeJavaObject[{1,2,3}] would create an int[] with these values). MakeJavaObject is a shorthand for calling
        JavaNew. It is typically used when you need to call a Java method that is typed to take Object, and you want to
        pass it a numeric, String, or array value. You use MakeJavaObject to manually convert such arguments into Java
        objects before passing them to the method.
