<h3><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/JLink/ref/ReturnAsJavaObject.html">ReturnAsJavaObject</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>ReturnAsJavaObject[expr] causes a Java method call or field access during the evaluation of expr to return its
        result as an object reference (that is, a JavaObject expression), not a value. Most Java objects are returned as
        references normally, but those that have a meaningful Wolfram Language representation are returned "by value".
        Such objects include strings, arrays, and the so-called wrapper classes like java.lang.Integer.
        ReturnAsJavaObject overrides the normal behavior and forces any object returned to the Wolfram Language to be
        sent only as a reference. It is typically used to avoid needlessly sending large arrays of numbers back and
        forth between Java and the Wolfram Language. You can use ReturnAsJavaObject to cause only a reference to be
        sent, then use the JavaObjectToExpression function at the end if the final value is needed.
