<h3><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/JLink/ref/SameObjectQ.html">SameObjectQ</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>SameObjectQ[javaobject1, javaobject2] returns True if and only if the JavaObject expressions javaobject1 and
        javaobject2 refer to the same Java object. In other words, it behaves like the Java language's == operator as
        applied to object references.
