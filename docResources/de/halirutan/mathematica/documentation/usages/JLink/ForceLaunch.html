<h3><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/search/?q=ForceLaunch">ForceLaunch</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>ForceLaunch is an option to ConnectToFrontEnd that forces a new instance of the front end to be launched as
        opposed to sharing a currently-running instance. The default is False. It is currently only supported on Windows
        (on other platforms a new instance is always launched).
