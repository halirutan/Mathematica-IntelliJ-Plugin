<h3><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/JLink/ref/JavaBlock.html">JavaBlock</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>JavaBlock[expr] causes all new Java objects returned to the Wolfram Language during the evaluation of expr to be
        released when expr finishes. It is an error to refer to such an object after JavaBlock ends. See the usage
        message for ReleaseJavaObject for more information. JavaBlock only affects new objects, not additional
        references to ones that have previously been seen. If a JavaBlock returns a single JavaObject as a result, that
        object will not be released. JavaBlock is a way to mark a set of objects as temporary so they can be
        automatically cleaned up when the block of code ends.
