<h3><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/JLink/ref/Methods.html">Methods</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>Methods[javaclass] returns a list (in TableForm) of the Java declarations for all methods of the specified
        class. You can also specify a class by its name or an object of that class, as in Methods["java.net.URL"] or
        Methods[javaobject]. To make them easier to read, the declarations have had removed some keywords that are not
        very relevant to their use from the Wolfram Language. These keywords are final, synchronized, and native. The
        public keyword is also removed, as the methods are always public.
