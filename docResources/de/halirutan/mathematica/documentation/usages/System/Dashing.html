<ul>
    <li>Dashing[{<em>r</em><sub>1</sub>,<em>r</em><sub>2</sub>,

        }] is a two-dimensional graphics directive specifying that lines that follow are to be drawn dashed, with
        successive segments of lengths <em>r</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>r</em><sub>2</sub>,
        <math>
            <ms>&#8230;</ms>
        </math>
        (repeated cyclically). The <em>r</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> are given as a fraction of the total width of the
        graph.
    <li>Dashing[<em>r</em>] is equivalent to Dashing[{<em>r</em>,<em>r</em>}].
