    <li>MachineName is an option to Encode which specifies the required value of $MachineName on the computer that reads
        the encoded file. If no value is specified, any value of $MachineName is allowed on the file-reading computer. A
        setting for MachineName must be a string. MachineName[kernel] gives the name of the machine on which kernel
        runs.
