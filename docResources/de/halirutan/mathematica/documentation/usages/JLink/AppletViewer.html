<ul>
    <li>AppletViewer[class, params] displays a window with an applet of the named class running in it. The class can be
        given as a string or a JavaClass expression. The params argument is a list of strings, each specifying a
        name=value pair supplying applet properties that would normally appear in an HTML file in
        <PARAM>
        tags or other applet attributes (like WIDTH and HEIGHT attributes). A typical specification might be
        {"WIDTH=400", "HEIGHT=400"}.
