<ul>
    <li>$RelaxedTypeChecking is a flag that can be set to True to speed up the validation performed in the Wolfram
        Language (via pattern tests) on arrays of data being sent as arguments to Java calls. For a very large matrix,
        it can be expensive to test that it is, say, a rectangular matrix of integers before it is sent to Java. The
        speed is gained by making the tests much less strict, so you must make sure that you pass methods exactly the
        arguments they expect. The default value is False. You can set and reset the value whenever you want; a typical
        use would be Block[{$RelaxedTypeChecking = True}, callToJava[largeMatrix]].
