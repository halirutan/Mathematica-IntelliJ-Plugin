<h3><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/JLink/ref/KeepJavaObject.html">KeepJavaObject</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>KeepJavaObject[object] causes the specified object(s) not to be released when the current JavaBlock ends.
        KeepJavaObject allows an object to "escape" from the current JavaBlock, and it only has an effect if the object
        was in fact slated to be released by the current block. The object is promoted to the "release" list of the
        next-enclosing JavaBlock, if there is one, so it will be released when that block ends (unless you call
        KeepJavaObject again in the outer block). KeepJavaObject[object, Manual] causes the specified object to escape
        from all enclosing JavaBlocks, meaning that the object will only be released if you manually call
        ReleaseJavaObject.
