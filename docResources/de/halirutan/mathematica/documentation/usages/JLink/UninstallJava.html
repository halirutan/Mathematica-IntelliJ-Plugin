<h3><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/JLink/ref/UninstallJava.html">UninstallJava</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>UninstallJava[] shuts down the Java runtime that was started by InstallJava. It is provided mainly for
        developers who are actively recompiling Java classes for use in the Wolfram Language and therefore need to shut
        down and restart the Java runtime to reload the modified classes. Users generally have no reason to call
        UninstallJava. The Java runtime is a shared resource used by potentially many Wolfram Language programs. You
        should leave it running unless you are absolutely sure you need to shut it down.
