<h3><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/search/?q=CommandLine">CommandLine</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>CommandLine is an option to InstallJava that specifies the first part of the command line that should be used to
        launch the Java runtime. You can use this option to specify a name other than "java" for the Java runtime, or if
        you have more than one version of Java installed and you need to specify the full path to the runtime you want
        launched. The value of this option does not specify the entire command line, however, as InstallJava may add
        some arguments to the end of the line, depending on other options.
