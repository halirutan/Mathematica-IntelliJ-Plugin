<h3><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/JLink/ref/JavaShow.html">JavaShow</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>JavaShow[windowObj] causes the specified Java window to be brought to the foreground, so that it appears in
        front of notebook windows. Use this function in place of standard Java window methods like setVisible (or its
        deprecated equivalent, show) and toFront. The effects those methods have are unfortunately not identical on
        different Java virtual machines and operating systems. JavaShow performs the required steps in VM-specific ways,
        so programs that use it will work identically on different configurations. The argument must be an object of a
        class that can represent a top-level window (i.e., an instance of the java.awt.Window class or a subclass).
