<h3><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/JLink/ref/JavaClassPath.html">JavaClassPath</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>JavaClassPath[] returns the class search path in use by the Java runtime. This includes classes specified via
        the CLASSPATH environment variable (if any), directories and files added by the user with AddToClassPath, and
        those directories automatically searched by J/Link. The result is a list of strings specifying directories and
        .jar or .zip files, in the same order that they will be searched for classes by the Java runtime.
