To get a free license, I need some information. In the issue description, please provide information about how you want to use the plugin:

1. Links to open-source projects
2. Information about academic or class-room usage

From this information, it must become clear that you are [eligible to obtain a free license](https://www.jetbrains.com/store/?fromNavMenu#discounts?billing=yearly). Furthermore, I need

- Your full name
- The email address that you use in your Jetbrains account

You can send this sensitive information to the following email address if you don't feel comfortable putting them online:
