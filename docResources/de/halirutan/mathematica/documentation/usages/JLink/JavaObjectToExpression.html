<ul>
    <li>JavaObjectToExpression[javaobject] converts the specified Java object reference into its value as a "native"
        Wolfram Language expression. Normally, all Java objects that have a meaningful "by value" representation in the
        Wolfram Language are returned by value to the Wolfram Language automatically. Such objects include strings,
        arrays (these become lists), and instances of so-called wrapper classes like java.lang.Integer. However, you can
        get a reference form of one of these types if you explicitly call JavaNew or use the ReturnAsJavaObject
        function. In such cases, you can use JavaObjectToExpression to retrieve the value. JavaObjectToExpression has no
        effect on objects that have no meaningful "value" representation in the Wolfram Language.
