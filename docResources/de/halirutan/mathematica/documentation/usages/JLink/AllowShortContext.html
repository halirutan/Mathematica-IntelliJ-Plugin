<h3><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/search/?q=AllowShortContext">AllowShortContext</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>AllowShortContext is an option to LoadJavaClass (in J/Link) and LoadNETType (in .NET/Link) that specifies
        whether to create a class-specific context in "short" form. If you load a class named "com.foo.Bar" containing a
        static method named baz, with the option AllowShortContext->True you could call the method with Bar`baz[args].
        With AllowShortContext->False, you would have to write com`foo`Bar`baz[args]. AllowShortContext->False allows
        you to avoid conflicts with other contexts in the system. The default is True.
