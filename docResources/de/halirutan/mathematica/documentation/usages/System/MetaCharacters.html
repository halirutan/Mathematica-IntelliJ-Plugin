<ul>
    <li>MetaCharacters is an option to StringPosition. With MetaCharacters -> None, no strings have special meanings.
        MetaCharacters -> {<em>c</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>c</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>c</em><sub>3</sub>} specifies the
        metacharacters for pattern escape, single character matching and multiple character matching. MetaCharacters ->
        Automatic is equivalent to MetaCharacters -> {"\\", ".", "*"}.
