<h3><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/search/?q=ServiceJava">ServiceJava</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>ServiceJava[] allows a single computation originating from Java to proceed. ServiceJava joins DoModal and
        ShareKernel as the means to allow computations to proceed that originate from Java. "Originate" from Java means
        that the call to Mathematica is in response to a user action in Java (like pressing a button), as opposed to a
        callback into Mathematica from a call to Java that originated from Mathematica. Use ServiceJava when you want a
        running Mathematica program to periodically allow computations from the Java user interface. ServiceJava, like
        ShareKernel, is unnecessary in Mathematica 5.1 and later because the kernel is always ready for computations
        that originate in Java, even when busy with another computation.
