consistent.compound.expression.in.file.name=Missing semicolon at file-scope
consistent.compound.expression.in.file.description=At file scope it is considered good code-style, when all separate expressions are closed with a semicolon.
consistent.compound.expression.in.file.message=Missing semicolon

bugs.implicit.times.through.linebreak.name=Multiplication through linebreak
bugs.implicit.times.through.linebreak.description=This linebreak is interpreted as multiplication. When two complete expressions are separated by a linebreak, then Mathematica interprets this as a multiplication. This is probably not intended.
bugs.implicit.times.through.linebreak.message=Missing comma or semicolon
bugs.unsupported.version.name=Function is part of later version
bugs.unsupported.version.description=Reports functions or symbols that are part of a later version of Mathematica than specified. Per default, the language version of the specified Mathematica SDK is used.
bugs.unsupported.version.association=Associations where introduced in version 10. You are using {0}.
bugs.unsupported.version.with=The feature of \"With\" having multiple definition lists was introduced in version 10.3. You are using {0}.

symbol.unresolved.name=Unresolved Symbol
symbol.unresolved.description=The place where this symbol is defined could not be found. This usually means that you used a symbol that has no definition, no usage message, is not a built-in symbol or is not locally bound by Module, Table, Compile, ...
