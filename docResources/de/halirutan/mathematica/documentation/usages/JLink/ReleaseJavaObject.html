<ul>
    <li>ReleaseJavaObject[javaobject] tells the Java memory-management system to forget about any references to the
        specified JavaObject that are being maintained solely for the sake of the Wolfram Language. The JavaObject in
        the Wolfram Language is no longer valid after the call. You call ReleaseJavaObject when you are completely
        finished with an object in the Wolfram Language, and you want to allow it to be garbage-collected in Java.
