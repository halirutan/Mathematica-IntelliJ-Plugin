<ul>
    <li>AddPeriodical[expr, interval] adds the computation expr to the set of operations that are periodically performed
        automatically. It returns an integer ID that can be used in RemovePeriodical. The time interval is specified in
        seconds, and can be less than one second, although the timing is not expected to be very precise.
