<ul>
    <li>MainSolve[<em>eqns</em>] is the underlying function for transforming systems of equations. Solve and Eliminate
        call it. The equations must be of the form <em>lhs</em> == <em>rhs</em>. They can be combined using && and ||.
        MainSolve returns False if no solutions to the equations exist, and True if all values of variables are
        solutions. MainSolve rearranges the equations using certain directives. MainSolve[<em>eqns</em>, <em>vars</em>,
        <em>elim</em>, <em>rest</em>] attempts to rearrange the equations <em>eqns</em> so as to solve for the variables
        <em>vars</em>, and eliminate the variables <em>elim</em>. The list <em>rest</em> can be included to specify the
        elimination order for any remaining variables.
