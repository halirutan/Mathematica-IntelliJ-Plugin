<h3><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/JLink/ref/BeginJavaBlock.html">BeginJavaBlock</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>BeginJavaBlock[] and EndJavaBlock[] are equivalent to the JavaBlock function, except that they work across a
        larger span than the evaluation of a single expression. Every BeginJavaBlock[] must have a paired
        EndJavaBlock[].
