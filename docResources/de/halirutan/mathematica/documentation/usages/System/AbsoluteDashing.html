        }] is a graphics directive which specifies that lines which follow are to be drawn dashed, with successive
        segments having absolute lengths <em>d</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>d</em><sub>2</sub>,
        <math>
            <ms>&#8230;</ms>
        </math>
        (repeated cyclically).
    <li>AbsoluteDashing[<em>d</em>] is equivalent to AbsoluteDashing[{<em>d</em>,<em>d</em>}].
