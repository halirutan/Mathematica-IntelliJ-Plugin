<h3><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/search/?q=UseTypeChecking">UseTypeChecking</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>UseTypeChecking is an option to LoadJavaClass that specifies whether to include or omit the type checking
        performed in the Wolfram Language on arguments to Java calls. The default is UseTypeChecking->True.
        UseTypeChecking is largely superseded by the flag $RelaxedTypeChecking. If you use UseTypeChecking->False, you
        must make sure you pass methods exactly the argument types they expect. Also note that J/Link will not be able
        to correctly differentiate between multiple definitions of the same method that take the same number of
        arguments. Most users will have no use for this option.
