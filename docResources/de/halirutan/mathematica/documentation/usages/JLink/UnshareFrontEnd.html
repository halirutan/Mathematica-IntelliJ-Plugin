<h3><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/search/?q=UnshareFrontEnd">UnshareFrontEnd</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>UnshareFrontEnd[token] is used to "unregister" an earlier call to ShareFrontEnd that returned the given token.
        When all calls to ShareFrontEnd have had a corresponding call to UnshareFrontEnd, front end sharing is turned
        off. UnshareFrontEnd[linkobject] turns off sharing of the front end with the given link. For backwards
        compatibility, calling UnshareFrontEnd[] with no arguments turns off sharing with the Java link (thus it is
        equivalent to UnshareFrontEnd[JavaLink[]]), but programmers should always use UnshareFrontEnd[token], passing
        the token returned from a previous call to ShareFrontEnd.
