<ul>
    <li>BrightnessEqualize[<em>image</em>] adjusts the brightness across <em>image</em>, correcting uneven illumination.
    <li>BrightnessEqualize[<em>image</em>,<em>flatfield</em>] uses the correction model given by <em>flatfield</em>,
        which models the variation in brightness across image.
    <li>BrightnessEqualize[<em>image</em>,<em>flatfield</em>,<em>darkfield</em>] uses the dark environment model given
        by <em>darkfield</em>.
