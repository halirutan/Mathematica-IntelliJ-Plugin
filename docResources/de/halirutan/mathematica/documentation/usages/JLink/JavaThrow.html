<h3><a href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/JLink/ref/JavaThrow.html">JavaThrow</a></h3>
<ul>
    <li>JavaThrow["exceptionClassName", "detailMsg"] causes the specified exception to be thrown in the Java thread that
        called the Wolfram Language program in which JavaThrow occurred. You can also call JavaThrow with an Exception
        object created by a call to JavaNew, instead of a string giving the name of the exception class. If you use the
        string form, the second argument is an optional detail message for the exception. It is up to the user to ensure
        that the exception being created has an appropriate constructor. JavaThrow is a specialized function that few
        programmers will have any use for.
